# R Shiny Web App for Portfolio Segmentation
This repository features a **R Shiny Web App** for training **Machine Learning** models for **Segmentation** tasks. This web app was initially implementend as part of my _master's thesis_ and now generalized to be published so that others have the chance of making use of it by adapting it for their purposes, for example. 

Using the dummy dataset (dummyData.csv - which has German csv notation) you can **explore the app** by playing with it [here](https://r-haase.shinyapps.io/R-Shiny-Web-App-for-Segmentation/). I tried to make it as easy to follow as possible.

Running it locally requires **R 3.2.4** to enjoy all features.

**Limitations of shinyapps.io deployment**:
- **Hyperparameter tuning** is simplified by setting the _tuneLength_ parameter of the **caret** package to 1 in order to speed up training for demonstration purposes.   
- _Bayesian Neural Network_ does not work but the other three algorithms do     
-  The deployed version above won't allow the installation of the _RGtk2_ package so that the visualization of the trained decision tree won't work. The _RGtk2_ package itself is a dependency of the _rattle_ package, which is currently commented out for server deployment. You can include it for local installation.     
- It seems as if trained models cannot be saved on the server so that the **Criteria Importance** feature and the **Prediction Tab** features will not work
