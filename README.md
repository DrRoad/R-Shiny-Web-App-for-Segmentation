# R Shiny Web App - Master's Thesis Implementation (generalized)
This repository features a **R Shiny Web App** for training **Machine Learning** models for **Segmentation** tasks. This web app was initially implementend as part of my _master's thesis_ and now generalized to be published so that others have the chance of making use of it by adapting it for their purposes, for example.
